# Force deep sleep (S3) instead of s2idle (S0ix) for better suspend/wake reliability
# This is especially important for ASUS laptops with NVIDIA hybrid graphics
#
# To check current sleep mode: cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
# [s2idle] deep  = s2idle is active (can cause wake issues)
# s2idle [deep]  = deep is active (more reliable)
